for Brazilian Unified Health System

Overview
This project is focused on providing data for a public health dashboard by reading, refining, and modeling data from public sources. The project aims to make code accessible and easy to extend for other developers.

The final goal is to provide accessibible and realiable information, to help people and public agents evaluate their actions and improve their next decisions to improve public health.

Features
Data Modeling: Creating data models that can be used for public health analysis.
Data Pipelines: Building efficient pipelines using PySpark to:
Read data from public health sources.
Refine the raw data.
Provide a clean and structured data model.
How to Use
Developers can navigate to the src folder to include new ELT/ETL jobs for processing additional tables used in public health analysis.

Technologies
PySpark: For distributed data processing.
Public Data Sources: The data is collected from various open health data platforms.
Contribution
Feel free to fork this repository and contribute. You can extend the code by adding new transformations or pipelines in the src folder.
